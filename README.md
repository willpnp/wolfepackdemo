## Overview

Wolfe Pack Demo was created to:

* Give a quick table of pre-defined columns after a login.
* Provide a universal search.

The current data for the table is in JSON format.

The app was implemented on AWS using an S3 bucket as a single page application.

Any use of code from this repository is on an as-is basis.
